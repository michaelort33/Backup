However, this case is a bit trickier than usual because \(x\) is in the denominator. Before isolating \(x\) from other terms or coefficients, we need to move \(x\) out of the denominator. To move \(x\) to the numerator, try multiplying both sides of the equation by \(x\). This will cancel the \(x\) in the denominator of 64. $$\frac{64}{x}x=16x$$ This simplifies to $$64=16x$$ Now that there is no \(x\) in the denominator, we can proceed as usual. Examine which terms or coefficients need to be moved away from the side of the equation with \(x\). In this case, there is a 16 multiplying \(x\). To cancel the 16 or move it to the other side of the equation, divide both sides by 16. $$\frac{64}{16}=\frac{16x}{16}$$ This simplifies to our answer $$\boxed{4=x}$$</p>"

However, this case is a bit trickier than usual because \(x\) there is a term with \(x\) on both sides of the equals sign. Before isolating \(x\) from other terms or coefficients, we need to combine the \(x\) terms. You can move either of the \(x\) terms to the other side to have both \(x\) terms on the same side. To keep things positive I will move the \(-2x\) term from the right side to the left side of the equals sign. To cancel the \(-2x\) on the right side, add \(2x\) to both sides of the equation. $$\frac{3}{2}x+2x=14$$ This simplifies to $$\frac{7}{2}x=14$$ Now we have one coefficient,\(\frac{7}{2}\) that still needs to be canceled. To cancel a coefficient of \(x\) you can divide by the coefficient. We can divide both sides of the equation by \(\frac{7}{2}\).

Take the first sentence:</p> <p> ""Shiva spends  <span>&#36;</span>10 a day on living expenses."" </p> <p>This can be translated to the algebraic equation $$m=s-10d$$ Where \(m\) is the amount of money Sheva has today, and \(s\) is the amount of money Sheva had \(d\) days ago. Since Sheva spends <span>&#36;</span>10  a day, subtract ten times the number of days that have passed from her starting money to reach her present money.</p><p>The second sentence can also be translated into an equation. The second sentence states:</p> <p>Today, she has half as much money as she had  a week ago (7 days ago). </p> <p>We can translate the sentence using the same variables we created for the first sentence. ""Today she has"" implies \(m=\). ""half as much money as she had"" implies \(\frac{1}{2}s\). Putting these two pieces together we get $$m=\frac{1}{2}s$$</p> Finally, the starting money is given as the money Shiva had seven days ago or \(d=7\). Therefore, using the first equation, \(m=s-10d\) and the second equation \(m=\frac{1}{2}s\) we can plug in \(d=7\) which is given and we have two equations with two unknowns: $$m=s-70$$ and $$m=\frac{1}{2}s$$ Substitute \(s-70\) in place of \(m\) in the second equation and solve for s: $$s-70=\frac{1}{2}s$$ Move terms with \(s\) to the same side of the equation by subtracting \(\frac{1}{2}s\) from both sides of the equation to get: $$\frac{1}{2}s-70=0$$ Now we can move non-s terms to the other side of the equals sign. Add 70 to both sides to get: $$\frac{1}{2}s=70$$ Cancel the s-coefficient by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of the coefficient: $$\frac{1}{2}x2=70(2)$$ This simplifies to $$s=140$$ However, we are not done. The question does not ask for \(s\) or the amount she had but for \(m\) the amount she has now. But we now know \(s=140\) to solve for m we can simply substitute 140 in place of \(s\) in the second equation to get $$m=\frac{1}{2}140\rightarrow \boxed{m=70}$$"

Since they are consecutive integers, the second number is the first number plus one and similarly, the third number is equal to the second number plus one. Therefore, the three numbers in terms of the first number are $$x,\;x+1\;x+2$$We are given that the sum of the three numbers equals 282.

However, there is an implied piece of information here: Tajo or Mika cannot have a half of a house. So \(x\) must be an integer. Since Mika has \(\frac{1}{4}\) more houses than Tajo, \(x\) must also be divisible by 4. Therefore, \(\frac{x}{4}\) is an integer too.

For most conversion questions, the question give some rate and asks for an answer in different units. In this case, it gives us cubic feet per second but it asks for an answer in cubic inches per minute. There are two units that change when go from cubic feet per second to inches per minute. One, cubic feet must be converted to cubic inches. Two, seconds must be converted to minutes. To solve, take one conversion at a time. First, we can convert cubic feet to cubic inches. The question tell us that there are \(12^3\) cubic inches in a cubic foot. This means there are \(1728in^3/ft\). Now lets multiply the rate by our conversion rate. Remember to place the unit that you want to cancel, in this case feet, on opposite sides of the fraction line: $$\frac{3ft^3}{1sec}\frac{1728in^3}{1ft^3}$$ The feet units cancel because the left unit is in the numerator and the right one is in the denominator. We are left with: $$\frac{3\times1728 in^3}{1sec}=\frac{5184in^3}{1sec}$$ We are halfway through we changed feet to inches. Now we only have to change seconds to minutes. Since seconds is on the denominator of Afan's rate, we want to put seconds in the numerator of our conversion rate. We have $$conversionRate=\frac{60sec}{1min}$$ Now, we multiply our rate by the conversion rate: $$\frac{5184in^3}{1sec}\times \frac{60sec}{1min}=\frac{5184 \times 60in^3}{1min}=\boxed{311040in^3}{sec}$$ In summary, we did very logical operations. We multiplied the numerator by 60 to go from the water poured per second to water poured per minute and we multiplied the numerator again, by 5184, to go from cubic feet of water to cubic inches of water.</p>"

Then, simply subtract this probability of not making at least 1 free throw from 1 get the answer. This works since the sum of the probabilities of every possible event must add up to 1.
