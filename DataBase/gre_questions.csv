To keep things positive I will move the \(-2x\) term from the right side to the left side of the equals sign.

Note: \(1ft=12in\: 1ft^2=144in^2 \: 1ft^3=1728in^3\) See a pattern? This is because each time we increase a dimension we have to multiply by the conversion rate again. I.e. the volume of a cube with sides equal to 1ft is \(1\cdot1\cdot1=1\) but in inches that is \(12\cdot12\cdot12=1728\) So a cube with volume equal to \(1ft^3\) has volume equal to \(1728in^3\)</p>",,,,,,"Kevin",

Take the first sentence:</p> <p> ""Shiva spends  <span>&#36;</span>10 a day on living expenses."" </p> <p>This can be translated to the algebraic equation $$m=s-10d$$ Where \(m\) is the amount of money Sheva has today, and \(s\) is the amount of money Sheva had \(d\) days ago. Since Sheva spends <span>&#36;</span>10  a day, subtract ten times the number of days that have passed from her starting money to reach her present money.</p><p>The second sentence can also be translated into an equation. The second sentence states:</p> <p>Today, she has half as much money as she had  a week ago (7 days ago). </p> <p>We can translate the sentence using the same variables we created for the first sentence. ""Today she has"" implies \(m=\). ""half as much money as she had"" implies \(\frac{1}{2}s\). Putting these two pieces together we get $$m=\frac{1}{2}s$$</p> Finally, the starting money is given as the money Shiva had seven days ago or \(d=7\). Therefore, using the first equation, \(m=s-10d\) and the second equation \(m=\frac{1}{2}s\) we can plug in \(d=7\) which is given and we have two equations with two unknowns: $$m=s-70$$ and $$m=\frac{1}{2}s$$ Substitute \(s-70\) in place of \(m\) in the second equation and solve for s: $$s-70=\frac{1}{2}s$$ Move terms with \(s\) to the same side of the equation by subtracting \(\frac{1}{2}s\) from both sides of the equation to get: $$\frac{1}{2}s-70=0$$ Now we can move non-s terms to the other side of the equals sign. Add 70 to both sides to get: $$\frac{1}{2}s=70$$ Cancel the s-coefficient by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of the coefficient: $$\frac{1}{2}x2=70(2)$$ This simplifies to $$s=140$$ However, we are not done. The question does not ask for \(s\) or the amount she had but for \(m\) the amount she has now. But we now know \(s=140\) to solve for m we can simply substitute 140 in place of \(s\) in the second equation to get $$m=\frac{1}{2}140\rightarrow \boxed{m=70}$$","GRE",,,"Friday Material",,,

This simplifies to Mika having \(\frac{5}{4}x\) houses. Combined they both have: $$x+\frac{5}{4}x=\frac{9}{4}x$$ So the total number of houses is \(\frac{9}{4}x\) where \(x\) is some unknown number. However, there is an implied piece of information here: Tajo or Mika cannot have a half of a house. So \(x\) must be an integer. Since Mika has \(\frac{1}{4}\) more houses than Tajo, \(x\) must also be divisible by 4. Therefore, \(\frac{x}{4}\) is an integer too. Recall the total number of houses was found to be \(\frac{9}{4}x\) since \(\frac{x}{4}\) is an integer we can rewrite that as: $$total=9\times integer$$ So whatever that integer is, it is a multiple of 9.

For most conversion questions, the question give some rate and asks for an answer in different units. In this case, it gives us cubic feet per second but it asks for an answer in cubic inches per minute. There are two units that change when go from cubic feet per second to inches per minute. One, cubic feet must be converted to cubic inches. Two, seconds must be converted to minutes. To solve, take one conversion at a time. First, we can convert cubic feet to cubic inches. The question tell us that there are \(12^3\) cubic inches in a cubic foot. This means there are \(1728in^3/ft\). Now lets multiply the rate by our conversion rate. Remember to place the unit that you want to cancel, in this case feet, on opposite sides of the fraction line: $$\frac{3ft^3}{1sec}\frac{1728in^3}{1ft^3}$$ The feet units cancel because the left unit is in the numerator and the right one is in the denominator. We are left with: $$\frac{3\times1728 in^3}{1sec}=\frac{5184in^3}{1sec}$$ We are halfway through we changed feet to inches. Now we only have to change seconds to minutes. Since seconds is on the denominator of Afan's rate, we want to put seconds in the numerator of our conversion rate. We have $$conversionRate=\frac{60sec}{1min}$$ Now, we multiply our rate by the conversion rate: $$\frac{5184in^3}{1sec}\times \frac{60sec}{1min}=\frac{5184 \times 60in^3}{1min}=\boxed{311040in^3}{sec}$$ In summary, we did very logical operations. We multiplied the numerator by 60 to go from the water poured per second to water poured per minute and we multiplied the numerator again, by 5184, to go from cubic feet of water to cubic inches of water.</p>",,,,"Friday Material",,,

Instead, use a trick: when a probability question has the words ""at least"" in it, you can usually calculate the complement, meaning the probability of not making at least 1. Then, simply subtract this probability of not making at least 1 free throw from 1 get the answer. This works since the sum of the probabilities of every possible event must add up to 1.

The only way to not make at least one is to miss all three. Lebron has x% chance of making a free throw so the probability of Lebron missing a free throw is 1-x%.
